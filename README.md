# Fresh11 (Sysfresh) â€“ OOBE Customization Toolkit

Fresh11 is a fast and efficient app remover for Windows 11, designed to eliminate unnecessary pre-installed apps (goodbye, bloatware). In addition to app removal, it offers customization options for enhancing the Windows 11 experience, particularly for versions 23H2 and 24H2. Originally part of the [FlybyScript](https://github.com/builtbybel/Flyby11), this feature has now been separated into its own tool for better flexibility and ease of use. Fresh11 provides quick, no-frills functionality with smart recommendations to make the process smoother.

This tool is perfect for users looking to streamline and personalize their Windows 11 setup with minimal effort.
